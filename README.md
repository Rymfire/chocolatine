# Chocolatine

Chocolatine is a Discord bot created as a side project. It's main purpose is to incite people to bring joy and happiness at work â€”joy and happiness being food, of course.

## Context

Until now, we used to punish people leaving their desk without locking their laptop by sending a message on Discord promissing to bring the next breakfast. Unfortunately, people start to get extra careful. And yet, we still want breakfasts on mornings.

Here comes the staff's solution: Chocolatine. They will select one random member of the server to bring the next breakfast and make people happy!
